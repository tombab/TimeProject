# Frontend Mentor - Time tracking dashboard

![Design preview for the Time tracking dashboard coding challenge](./src/assets/desktop-preview.jpg)

This is the solution to my frontend Mentor project using React.js Scss and typescript.

This project is divide in 2 components : The header and the cards components.

The main features is that you can change the timeframes of each activities when you click on the dayly, weekly or monthly button.
I change the data.json to a data.tsx and add some types.

I'd love some feedback
Thanks
